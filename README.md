Below is an operations research question. Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.

# Question:
Our factory produces five types of components: bolts, nuts, screws, gears, and bearings, which require 2 workers and 1 machine respectively; 3 workers, 2 machines; 5 workers, 3 machines; 1 worker, 2 machines; Four workers and four machines. The profit for each bolt is 80 yuan, the profit for each nut is 90 yuan, the profit for each screw is 130 yuan, the profit for each gear is 50 yuan, and the profit for each bearing is 100 yuan. The factory has a total of 200 workers and 180 machines. According to regulations, the production quantity of bolts shall not be less than 5, nuts shall not be less than 4, screws shall not be less than 6, gears shall not be less than 8, and bearings shall not be less than 10. How many bolts, nuts, screws, gears, and bearings can our factory produce to achieve maximum profit?

# Response:
## Mathematical Model:
### Decision Variables:
- \( x_1 \): Number of bolts produced (integer)
- \( x_2 \): Number of nuts produced (integer)
- \( x_3 \): Number of screws produced (integer)
- \( x_4 \): Number of gears produced (integer)
- \( x_5 \): Number of bearings produced (integer)

### Objective Function:
- Maximize total profit: \( Z = 80x_1 + 90x_2 + 130x_3 + 50x_4 + 100x_5 \)

### Constraints:
1. Worker constraint: \( 2x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3 + 1x_4 + 4x_5 \leq 200 \)
2. Machine constraint: \( x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 + 2x_4 + 4x_5 \leq 180 \)
3. Production quantity constraints:
   - \( x_1 \geq 5 \)
   - \( x_2 \geq 4 \)
   - \( x_3 \geq 6 \)
   - \( x_4 \geq 8 \)
   - \( x_5 \geq 10 \)

### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:
- \( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 \geq 0 \) and must be integers.

## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:
```python
import coptpy as cp
from coptpy import COPT

# Create a COPT environment
env = cp.Envr()

# Create the model
model = env.createModel("FactoryProductionOptimization")

# Define decision variables
x1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name="Bolts")
x2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name="Nuts")
x3 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name="Screws")
x4 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name="Gears")
x5 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name="Bearings")

# Set the objective function
model.setObjective(80*x1 + 90*x2 + 130*x3 + 50*x4 + 100*x5, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)

# Add constraints
model.addConstr(2*x1 + 3*x2 + 5*x3 + 1*x4 + 4*x5 <= 200, name="WorkerConstraint")
model.addConstr(x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3 + 2*x4 + 4*x5 <= 180, name="MachineConstraint")
model.addConstr(x1 >= 5, name="BoltsMin")
model.addConstr(x2 >= 4, name="NutsMin")
model.addConstr(x3 >= 6, name="ScrewsMin")
model.addConstr(x4 >= 8, name="GearsMin")
model.addConstr(x5 >= 10, name="BearingsMin")

# Solve the model
model.solve()

# Output the results
if model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:
    print("Maximum total profit: ${}".format(model.objval))
    print("Number of bolts produced: {}".format(x1.x))
    print("Number of nuts produced: {}".format(x2.x))
    print("Number of screws produced: {}".format(x3.x))
    print("Number of gears produced: {}".format(x4.x))
    print("Number of bearings produced: {}".format(x5.x))
else:
    print("No optimal solution found.")
```

This Python script uses `coptpy` to solve the factory production problem. The script first imports `coptpy` and creates a `COPT` environment. Then, it creates a model named "FactoryProductionOptimization" and adds five integer decision variables representing the number of bolts, nuts, screws, gears, and bearings to be produced.

Next, the script sets the objective function to maximize the total profit, which is calculated by multiplying the profit per unit of each component by the number of units produced.

The script then adds five constraints:
1. Worker constraint: Ensures the total number of workers required for all components does not exceed the available 200 workers.
2. Machine constraint: Ensures the total number of machines required for all components does not exceed the available 180 machines.
3. Production quantity constraints: Ensures that the production of each type of component meets or exceeds the minimum required quantity (5 for bolts, 4 for nuts, 6 for screws, 8 for gears, and 10 for bearings).

Finally, the script solves the model and outputs the maximum total profit and the number of each type of component produced if an optimal solution is found. If no optimal solution is found, it outputs a corresponding message. This script provides a method to solve the factory production problem using `coptpy`. It optimizes the production quantity of each type of component to maximize profit while satisfying the constraints on workers and machines. This solution can help the factory make the most of its resources and increase profitability.

Note: In the script, the `COPT.INTEGER` constraint is used to ensure that the variables are integers, as the number of components to be produced must be an integer. The `COPT` environment and model are used to define the optimization problem and solve it, respectively. The `model.solve()` method is used to solve the model, and the `model.status` and `model.objval` attributes are used to check the solution status and output the results. If the model has an optimal solution, it will output the maximum total profit and the number of each type of component produced. If no optimal solution is found, it will output a corresponding message. The `print` function is used to output the results, including the maximum total profit and the number of each type of component produced. The `format` method is used to format the output of the maximum total profit. If the number of components produced is not an integer, the output may not be correct, as the number of components produced must be an integer. Therefore, it is necessary to use the `COPT.INTEGER` constraint to ensure that the variables are integers. This constraint can also prevent the solver from considering non-integer solutions, which can improve the efficiency of the solver. In summary, the script provides a complete solution to the factory production problem using `coptpy`, including defining the decision variables, setting the objective function, adding the constraints, solving the model, and outputting the results. This solution can be used to optimize the production of various components in a factory to maximize profitability.
